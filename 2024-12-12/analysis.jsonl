In the world of weight, a gigaton stands as a massive unit of measure, equivalent to one billion metric tons. It’s typically used to discuss monumental forces or impacts, such as energy explosions or carbon emissions measured on a global scale—like the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere. But in this arena, the numbers don’t lie, and the chads using gigatons to measure are calculating world-shaking impacts. Massive force. Legendary impact. Crush them. Dominate. Move forward."}
